The presence of this file indicates `cargo mobile init` has been called for
the first time on a new project, but hasn't yet completed successfully once. As
long as this file is here, `cargo mobile init` will use a more aggressive
template generation strategy that allows it to place files that it wouldn't
normally be able to modify.

If you believe this file isn't supposed to be here, please report this, and then
delete this file to regain normal behavior.

Alternatively, if you do that and then realize that you were wrong (ouch!) and
your project was never fully generated, then you can just create `.first-init`
again (the contents don't matter) and run `cargo mobile init`. Just, if you do
that, any generated files you modified will be overwritten!
